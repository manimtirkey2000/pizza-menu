# Fast React Pizza Co.

-----

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to **Fast React Pizza Co.**, a simple yet engaging React application that showcases a fictional pizza restaurant's menu. This project is built to demonstrate fundamental React concepts, including component-based architecture, props, state management (implicitly through `pizzaData`), and conditional rendering.

-----

## ✨ Features

  * **Dynamic Menu Display**: Fetches and displays pizza data from a local data source.
  * **Pizza Details**: Each pizza shows its name, ingredients, and price.
  * **"Sold Out" Indicator**: Clearly marks pizzas that are currently unavailable.
  * **Operating Hours**: Dynamically displays the restaurant's opening and closing hours, and a "Come back later\!" message when closed.
  * **Order Button**: A functional "Order Now" button (though its functionality is not implemented in this version).
  * **Responsive Design**: Basic styling is included to make the app presentable.

-----

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  * **HTML5**: Structure of the web application.
  * **CSS3**: Styling of the components.
